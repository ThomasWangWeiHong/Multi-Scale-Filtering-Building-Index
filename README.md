# Multi-Scale-Filtering-Building-Index
Python implementation of building extraction index proposed in academic paper

This repository contains functions to generate grayscale images, and the various Multi - Scale Filtering Building Index (MFBI) and
their variants, like the Multichannel Multi - Scale Filtering Building Index (MMFBI) as proposed in the paper 
'A Multi - Scale Filtering Building Index for Building Extraction in Very High - Resolution Satellite Imagery' by
Bi Q., Qin K., Zhang H., Zhang Y., Li Z., Xu K. (2019).

Requirements:
- cv2
- numpy
- rasterio
- skimage
- sklearn
- tqdm
